# Bayesian_Optimizer_Option_Portfolios
Using RobinHood API for stock and options data, implement Bayesian Optimization for constructing risk-defined options & derivatives portfolios.  Applies a 2-stage approach with the Bayesian optimizer first exploring the parameter space, then in the second stage exploit the paramaeter subspace discovered in Stage 1 to attempt to find an even more optimized solution.
